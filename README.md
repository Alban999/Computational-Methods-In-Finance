# Computational-Methods-In-Finance

This repository contains different cases study for the 'Computational Methods in Finance' class at Columbia University:

- Case study 1: Study of the Black-Scholes framework for specific parameters.
- Case study 2: Study of the pricing of an up-and-out call. Explicit-implicit finite difference scheme to solve PIDE.
- Case study 3: Obtaining Heston and VGSA parameters via calibration to S&P 500 options. Study of the volatility surface for each model.
- Case study 4: Estimating parameters for the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model via filtering techniques: Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter.
